This is the experiment 3 for Creation & Computation Course at OCAD University.

It need to work with IFTTT, Adafruit IO, P5.Serialcontrol and Arduino. The folder contains p5.js and arduino code. P5.js is reading the data from Adafruit IO which recieved the value from IFTTT.

The recipes in IFTTT are: If anyone tweet about #sad then send a value "1" to my Channel in Adafruit IO, 
                          If anyone tweet about #happy then send a value "0" to my Channel in Adafruit IO.
